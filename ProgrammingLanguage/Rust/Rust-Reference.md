# Rust 学习与实践资料索引

# Overview

* [2017-Deep drive into rust programming language](https://parg.co/UP1)

- [2018-Why is Rust difficult?](https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html): Rust is considered difficult to learn by many people but I don’t consider it necessarily a bad thing for a language to be hard to learn.

## Case Study

* [Why Rust is the future of robotics](https://parg.co/UVu): We believe Rust is the future of robotics because it enables developers to be fearless, to create and enforce standards, and to build and rely on a strong community.

## CheatSheet

* [2017-Rust CheatSheet](http://phaiax.github.io/rust-cheatsheet/)

# Book

* [The Rust Programming Language #Book#](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/README.html): This book will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.

- [Rust Books #Project#](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks): 一系列对于 Rust 书籍的搜集

- [Rust Primer #Book#](https://github.com/rustcc/RustPrimer): 中国人写的 Rust 编程书籍

* [Rust by Example #Book#](https://rustbyexample.com/): Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

* [2017-Programming Rust #Book#](https://parg.co/UPe): This practical book introduces systems programmers to Rust, the new and cutting-edge language. You’ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level control—imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.

* [2017-Rust Essentials-Second Edition #Book#](https://parg.co/UPI): Leverage the functional programming and concurrency features of Rust and speed up your application development.

- [2016-Algorithm Cookbook in Rust #Book#](https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms): A collection of classic data structures and algorithms, emphasizing beauty and clarity over full generality.

* [2016-Rust-101](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html): This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.
