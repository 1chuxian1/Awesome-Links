* [2017-Building Progressive Web Games #Series#](https://medium.com/@prateekbh/progressive-web-games-part-1-62dcb89c39ff): All app-stores(Google play/iTunes/Windows app store) are filled with tons of games ranging from really simple ones to super complex ones. These games are downloaded millions of times. With the power of PWAs, a lot of these are perfect candidates to be brought to the web instead.

* [2017-Phaser #Project#](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser): Phaser is a fun, free and fast 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile web browsers, supporting Canvas and WebGL rendering.
