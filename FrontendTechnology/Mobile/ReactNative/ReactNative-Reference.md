* [Moving Beyond Animations to User Interactions at 60 FPS in React Native](https://hackernoon.com/moving-beyond-animations-to-user-interactions-at-60-fps-in-react-native-b6b1fa0ba525#.s9qc4wo93): The async nature of the React Native bridge incurs an inherent performance penalty, preventing JavaScript code from running at high framerates. Modern animation libraries, like Animated, address this by minimizing passes over the bridge. User interactions, where UI continuously reacts to the user’s gestures, are a step further. How can we run those at 60 FPS?
