# Virtualization OpenSource Reference

* [LightVM #Project#](http://cnp.neclab.eu/projects/lightvm/): . With LightVM we examine whether there is indeed a strict tradeoff between isolation (VMs) and efficiency (containers). We find that VMs can be as nimble as containers, as long as they are small and the toolstack is fast enough.

* [TinyVM #Project#](https://github.com/jakogut/tinyvm): TinyVM is a virtual machine with the goal of having a small footprint. Low memory usage, a small amount of code, and a small binary.
