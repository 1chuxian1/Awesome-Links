## JavaScript

* [2017-A blockchain in 200 lines of code](http://6me.us/8sPpk): This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. Here I will go through a super-simple blockchain I implemented in 200 lines of Javascript called NaiveChain.

* [2017-NodeJS blockchain implementation: BrewChain: Chain+WebSockets+HTTP Server](http://www.darrenbeck.co.uk/blockchain/nodejs/nodejscrypto/): In this tutorial you’ll lean to create BrewChain - a verifiable chain of which member of the team made a brew and when.

## Python

* [2017-Crackcoin](https://github.com/DutchGraa/crackcoin): Crackcoin is a very basic blockchain-free cryptocurrency PoC in Python.

* [2017-Let’s Build the Tiniest Blockchain](https://parg.co/baX): In Less Than 50 Lines of Python.

- [2017-Dumbcoin #Project#](https://parg.co/UsN): An educational python implementation of a bitcoin-like blockchain
