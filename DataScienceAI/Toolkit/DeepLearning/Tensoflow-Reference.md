# Tensorflow 学习与实践资料索引

# Overview

* [2017-Tensorflow demystified](https://chatbotslife.com/tensorflow-demystified-80987184faf7): To understand a new framework, Google’s Tensorflow is a framework for machine-learning calculations, it is often useful to see a ‘toy’ example and learn from it.

* [2017-Effective TensorFlow](https://github.com/vahidk/EffectiveTensorflow): My attempt is to gradually expand this series by adding new articles and keep the content up to date with the latest releases of TensorFlow API.

* [2017-TensorFlow-World](https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World): This repository is aimed to provide simple and ready-to-use tutorials for TensorFlow.

* [2017-CS 20SI: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/)

* [2017-TensorFlow 101](https://mubaris.com/2017-10-21/tensorflow-101): TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library developed at Google. TensorFlow uses data flow graphs for numerical computations.

* [如何将 TensorFlow 用作计算框架](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30719727): 如果你刚刚接触 TensorFlow 并想使用其来作为计算框架，那么本文是你的一个很好的选择，阅读它相信会对你有所帮助。
