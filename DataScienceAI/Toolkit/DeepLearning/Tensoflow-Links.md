# Overview

* [2017- TensorFlow demystified](https://chatbotslife.com/tensorflow-demystified-80987184faf7): To understand a new framework, Google’s TensorFlow is a framework for machine-learning calculations, it is often useful to see a ‘toy’ example and learn from it.

* [2017-Effective TensorFlow](https://github.com/vahidk/EffectiveTensorflow): My attempt is to gradually expand this series by adding new articles and keep the content up to date with the latest releases of TensorFlow API.

* [2017-TensorFlow-World](https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World): This repository is aimed to provide simple and ready-to-use tutorials for TensorFlow.

* [2017-CS 20SI: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/)

* [2017-TensorFlow 101](https://mubaris.com/2017-10-21/tensorflow-101): TensorFlow is an open source machine learning library developed at Google. TensorFlow uses data flow graphs for numerical computations.

* [如何将 TensorFlow 用作计算框架](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/30719727): 如果你刚刚接触 TensorFlow 并想使用其来作为计算框架，那么本文是你的一个很好的选择，阅读它相信会对你有所帮助。

# Resource

## Book

## Collection

* [TensorFlow-World-Resources #Collection#](https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World-Resources): Organized & Useful Resources about Deep Learning with TensorFlow

## Example Models

* [TensorFlow Models by Sarasra](https://github.com/Sarasra/models): This repository contains a number of different models implemented in TensorFlow: the official models, the research models, the samples folder and the tutorials folder.

* [TensorFlow Project Template](https://github.com/Mrgemy95/ TensorFlow-Project-Template): A simple and well designed structure is essential for any Deep Learning project, so after a lot of practice and contributing in tensorflow projects here's a tensorflow project template that combines simplcity, best practice for folder structure and good OOP design.

* [Deep-Learning-21-Examples](https://github.com/hzy46/Deep-Learning-21-Examples): 本工程是《21 个项目玩转深度学习———基于 TensorFlow 的实践详解》的配套代码，代码推荐的运行环境为：Ubuntu 14.04，Python 2.7、TensorFlow >= 1.4.0。请尽量使用类 UNIX 系统和 Python 2 运行本书的代码。
