- [Deepo #Project#](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo): Deepo is a Docker image with a full reproducible deep learning research environment. It contains most popular deep learning frameworks: theano, tensorflow, sonnet, pytorch, keras, lasagne, mxnet, cntk, chainer, caffe, torch.

- [2017-Turi Create #Project#](https://github.com/apple/turicreate): Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app.

- [2015-Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/): At the moment, deep learning is held together by an extremely successful tool. This tool doesn’t seem fundamental; it’s something we’ve stumbled on, with seemingly arbitrary details that change regularly. As a field, we don’t yet have some unifying insight or shared understanding. In fact, the field has several competing narratives!
