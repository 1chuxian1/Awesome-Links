* [2017-Neural Networks in JavaScript with deeplearn.js](https://parg.co/Upo): At this point in time of writing the article, I learn about the topic myself and try to internalize my learnings by writing about them and applying them in JavaScript.

* [2017-GPU-accelerated Neural Networks in JavaScript](https://parg.co/UxZ): This article looks at the ongoing convergence of these trends and provides an overview of the projects that are bringing GPU-accelerated neural networks to the JavaScript world.
