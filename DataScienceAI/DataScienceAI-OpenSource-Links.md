# DataScienceAI OpenSource Links

- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset): Apache Superset (incubating) is a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application. [Superset: Airbnb’s data exploration platform](https://parg.co/bIh)

* [Deepo #Project#](https://github.com/ufoym/deepo): Deepo is a Docker image with a full reproducible deep learning research environment. It contains most popular deep learning frameworks: theano, tensorflow, sonnet, pytorch, keras, lasagne, mxnet, cntk, chainer, caffe, torch.

* [2017-Turi Create #Project#](https://github.com/apple/turicreate): Turi Create simplifies the development of custom machine learning models. You don't have to be a machine learning expert to add recommendations, object detection, image classification, image similarity or activity classification to your app.

# Machine Learning

- [feature-selector #Project#](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/feature-selector): Feature selector is a tool for dimensionality reduction of machine learning datasets

# Natural Language Processing

- [Snips NLU #Project#](https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu): Snips NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a Python library that allows to parse sentences written in natural language and extracts structured information.

* [Word2Bits #Project#](https://github.com/agnusmaximus/Word2Bits): Word2Bits extends the Word2Vec algorithm to output high quality quantized word vectors that take 8x-16x less storage/memory than regular word vectors.

* [SnowNLP #Project#](https://github.com/isnowfy/snownlp): SnowNLP 是一个 Python 写的类库，可以方便的处理中文文本内容，是受到了 TextBlob 的启发而写的，由于现在大部分的自然语言处理库基本都是针对英文的，于是写了一个方便处理中文的类库，并且和 TextBlob 不同的是，这里没有用 NLTK，所有的算法都是自己实现的，并且自带了一些训练好的字典。

- [ansj_seg #Project#](https://github.com/NLPchina/ansj_seg): ansj 分词.ict 的真正 java 实现.分词效果速度都超过开源版的 ict. 中文分词,人名识别,词性标注,用户自定义词典。

# Deep Learning

- [tfjs #Project#](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs): A WebGL accelerated, browser based JavaScript library for training and deploying ML models.

- [brain.js #Project#](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js): brain.js is a library of Neural Networks written in JavaScript.

- [neurojs](https://github.com/janhuenermann/neurojs): neurojs is a JavaScript framework for deep learning in the browser. It mainly focuses on reinforcement learning, but can be used for any neural network based task. It contains neat demos to visualise these capabilities, for instance a 2D self-driving car.

# Computer Vision

- [2017-Detectron #Project#](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron): Detectron is Facebook AI Research's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Mask R-CNN.

- [2018-Faceswap #Project#](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap): Faceswap is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos.

- [2018-FastPhotoStyle #Project#](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FastPhotoStyle): This code repository contains an implementation of our fast photorealistic style transfer algorithm.

- [2018-pico.js #Project#](https://github.com/tehnokv/picojs): a face-detection library in 200 lines of JavaScript

* [face-api.js #Project#](): JavaScript API for Face Recognition in the Browser with tensorflow.js.
