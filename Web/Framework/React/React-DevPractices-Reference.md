* [2017-Higher Order Components with Functional Patterns Using Recompose](https://egghead.io/courses/higher-order-components-with-functional-patterns-using-recompose): In this course, you will learn to use many of the most powerful and convenient higher-order components within Recompose by coding several real-world examples. Using recompose looks very different from “vanilla” React; so you will also get comfortable with the look and feel of a “recomposed” component. The best part is no more need for class components! You’ll learn how to use Recompose to both modify components and also create your own higher-order components.

Although I’m using React, the lessons are universal and can apply to any framework.
